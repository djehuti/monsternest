# Monsternest

**Monsternest** is a game that I wrote some time in 1983.
There are both VIC-20 and C-64 versions here.
I _think_ I wrote the VIC-20 version first
(since I got a VIC-20 on December 18, 1982),
but I can't prove it.

## Commodore VIC-20

There's one printout of the VIC-20 version of the game.
It has a scrawled copyright change on it from when my friend
and I tried to sell it.
As a cassette in a baggie in the local computer shop.

We sold one copy; it didn't work on the customer's machine,
though, because he had a RAM expansion cartridge which
_changed the mapped address of the joystick ports_,
and I didn't have one to try to fix it.
So we had to refund the customer's money.

Note that this program is COPY PROTECTED!
That is: if you say "no" when it asks if you want to
play again, it does NEW and clears
the program! DIABOLICAL!

## Commodore 64

There are two original printouts of the game. One has the
Commodore on-screen glyphs for the control characters;
the other has the key codes for them.
(I think this one was printed on an MPS-801.)
